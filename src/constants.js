    question: 'What is yield farming?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Yield farming is the practice of putting your crypto assets to work via staking or lending
        to generate returns and earn rewards in the form of additional cryptocurrency. This process
        can be done manually by anyone in DeFi or automated via platforms such as Harvest that
        maximize your returns with the latest yield strategies & auto-compounding mechanism.

            Yield farming is a highly manual process and inconvenient for people that cannot keep up
            with the latest updates 24/7. Harvest automates the yield farming process by regularly
            harvesting & auto-compounding rewards at a significantly lower cost for users.

          <li>Governance decisions of the underlying platform</li>
          <li>
            Change of incentives like the number of emissions directed to profit share, fundamental
            tokenomics or dynamics such as the 4% emission reduction every week

          <li>
            Swings in the price of FARM token (which is used for incentives) can deviate the APY.

          <li>Large changes in TVL may dilute rewards and reduce APY. </li>
          <li>
            Market volume in LP assets farmed can also have an impact on the APY movement as a high

          The stated APR/APY (the &apos;Rate&apos;) is denominated in terms of relevant underlying
          tokens in the vaults. The Rate is a forward-looking projection based on our good faith
          belief of how to project results over the relevant period reasonably, but such belief is
          subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties (including smart contract
          security risks and third-party actions) which could result in a materially different
          (lower or higher) token-denominated APR/APY. The Rate is not a promise, guarantee, or
          undertaking on the part of any person or group of persons but depends entirely on the
          results of the operation of smart contracts and other autonomous systems (including
          third-party systems) and how third parties interact with those systems after the time of
          your deposit. Even if the Rate is achieved as projected, you may still suffer a financial
          loss in fiat-denominated terms if the fiat-denominated value of the relevant tokens (your
          deposit and any tokens allocated or distributed to you pursuant to the Rate) declines

        Harvest does not charge you any deposit/withdrawal fee. There is only a performance fee

        Harvest is an international cooperative of users pooling resources to earn DeFi yields. When
        users (also referred to as farmers) deposit their assets into one of the farming strategies
        available in the app, Harvest automatically puts them to work to earn the{' '}

        Wido is a 3rd party zap provider which Harvest uses under the hood. With Wido, users can
        deposit any token into any farm, for example, $USDC into an $ETH farm. Wido takes care of
        the token conversion for you at the best rates so that you don’t have to leave Harvest to
        swap tokens elsewhere manually.

    question: 'Why do I need to Deposit and then additionally Stake my tokens?',
    answer: (
      <>
        The first step to getting started farming with Harvest is to wrap your token into Harvest’s
        f_Token, such as fUSDC. From here, you can 1) use it for farming on Harvest to be entitled
        to all rewards, 2) take it to another DeFi platform for yield derivatives, interest rates,
        or use as collateral.
        <br />
        <br />
        Staking your fToken on Harvest only then entitles you to full APY of the given farm.

    question: 'Why is the gas fee for depositing and withdrawing so high?',
    answer: (
      <>
        Interacting with our farms, whether depositing or withdrawing, comes with network fees.
        Depending on network congestion, the fees can be temporarily higher than usual. We suggest
        coming back later for lower fees. (Tip: Sundays are usually low in network activity compared
        to the rest of the weekdays)

        Withdrawing is a two-step process. First, you need to unstake your fToken from Harvest.
        Then, to finally withdraw your fToken into your input token, e.g., USDC, hit the “Withdraw”
        button for the tokens to appear in your wallet, such as Metamask.

    question: 'What is the utility of FARM token?',
    answer: (
      <>
        FARM fuels the Harvest platform. It is simultaneously a reward token for users, a payment
        token for Harvest workers, and a governance token. Its supply is limited to 690,420 tokens.
        FARM is also a cash flow token for Harvest. When Harvest’s farms generate yields, 70% (70%
        on Ethereum Network, 92% on other chains) of these yields are used to increase the value of
        the deposits. The remaining 30% (30% on Ethereum Network, 8% on other chains) are converted
        into FARM tokens which are then used to reward farmers who staked their FARM into the FARM
        pool on Ethereum Network. Hence the name ‘Profit-Sharing.’
        <br />
        <br />
        The Profit-Sharing pool has implications for the value of iFARM - the yield-bearing FARM.
        iFARM is using the FARM pool under the hood. iFARM acts as FARM staked in the Profit-Sharing
        pool. Its main advantages are 1) a lower gas cost, 2) transferability and 3) further new
        utilities (e.g. lending collateralization).
